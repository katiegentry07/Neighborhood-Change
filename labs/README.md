### Lab 02: Developing Community Indices to Measure Change (Submitted 03/30/20)

**Description:** For this lab we looked at how distressed urban communities change between 2000 and 2010. Median home value with be one of the primary variables we will use in the model since it captures a lot of information about the ‘neighborhood’ (census tract). But we will also utilize some neighborhood health metrics as predictors and outcomes.

### Lab 03: Preparing Data For Analysis (submitted 4/13/20)

**Description:** For this lab we worked on preparing your dataset for analysis and streamlining the process of making sense of the data by improving the documentation and by writing some helper functions that will allow you to query the Longitudinal Tracts Data Base to search for the variables you need for your analysis.

### Lab 04: Descriptive Analysis (Submitted 4/13/20)

**Description:** For this lab we calculated change in the MHV variable between 1990 and 2000, and measured gentrification which occurs between 2000-2010. We then picked a city and created a new dorling cartogram to visualize your data. We then prepared descriptive statistics and chloropleth maps describing the MHV change variable, gentrification, and your neighborhood health metrics.
